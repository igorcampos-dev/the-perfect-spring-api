# Let's craft the perfect Spring Boot REST API? üèÜüçÉ

API for a collaborative task management system, where users can create projects, assign tasks to team members, track progress, and collaborate efficiently.


## Project Definition üìã

The API should support the following features:

1. **Authentication and Authorization:**
- Implement a robust authentication and authorization system using Spring Security. Ensure different levels of access for regular users, manager, and team members.

2. **Project Management:**
- Create endpoints to create, update, delete, and view information about projects. This may include project details, deadlines, associated team members, etc.

3. **Tasks and Subtasks:**
- Allow users to create tasks and subdivide them into subtasks if necessary. Each task can have an assignee, deadline, and completion status.

4. **Task Assignment:**
- Implement the ability to assign tasks to specific team members. Users should be able to accept or decline assignments.

5. **Comments and Discussions:**
- Provide functionality to add comments to tasks, enabling discussions among team members regarding a specific task.

6. **Notifications:**
- Set up email or push notification alerts to inform users about newly assigned tasks, changes in task status, etc.

7. **Reports and Statistics:**
- Implement endpoints that allow users to obtain reports and statistics on project progress. This may include completion charts, average completion time, etc.

8. **Integration with Third-Party Tools:**
- Integrate the API with third-party tools such as Google Calendar or Slack to enhance collaboration and integration with other productivity tools.

9. **Security:**
- Ensure API security by employing best practices, such as input validation, prevention against injection attacks, etc.

10. **Documentation:**
- Create detailed API documentation using Swagger or a similar tool.

11. **Unit Tests:**
- Create unit tests for API.

12. **Cache:**
- Mantain cache of the most use resources
